# NeuroDJ

A spontaneous song recommender system that uses simulated brainwave data and Bayesian optimization to learn your music preferences based on your current emotional state.

## Overview

NeuroDJ combines neuroscience-inspired signal processing with machine learning to create an adaptive music recommendation system. The system simulates EEG (electroencephalogram) brainwave patterns based on your mood, then uses Bayesian optimization to learn your music preferences through interactive feedback.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with Spotify (currently uses dummy data) [in progress]
- EEG device integration (Muse, OpenBCI) and real-time mood detection from actual brainwaves
